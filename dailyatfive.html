                       This is mainly attributed to a  <span class = "big-text">lack of satisfactory service.</span>
                       But the focus for MaidAid is to provide domestic help when
                       you need them the most. This usually happens when the
                       employed maid runs off or takes a unexpected leave leaving
                        the consumers helpless. The bigger picture we want to
